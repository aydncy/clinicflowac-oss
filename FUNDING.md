# ClinicFlowAC — Funding Overview

ClinicFlowAC is an open execution infrastructure project for small-clinic healthcare operations.

It addresses a structural gap: clinics operate over messaging tools, but lack interoperable execution infrastructure.

---

## Problem

Small and mid-sized clinics globally rely on:
- WhatsApp
- Email
- SMS
- Phone calls

Operational consequences:
- Missed appointments
- Incomplete documentation
- Consent ambiguity
- No audit trail
- Legal and compliance risk

The world has digital communication.
It lacks structured execution.

---

## Solution

ClinicFlowAC provides:

- Open Workflow Event Specification (WES)
- Append-only operational event log
- Consent integrity model
- Interoperable proof pack export format
- Channel-agnostic workflow abstraction

It is not an EHR replacement.
It is an operational execution layer.

---

## Public Deliverables

The project commits to producing:

1. Open Workflow Event Specification (SPEC.md)
2. Proof Pack Format (examples provided)
3. Reference implementation (self-hostable)
4. Integrity layer (hash chaining)
5. Documentation & onboarding guide

All outputs are released under MIT license.

## Funding Objectives

Funding will accelerate:

- Production-grade MVP
- Security hardening
- Interoperability refinement
- Pilot onboarding (3–5 clinics)
- Measurable impact reporting

---

## 2026 Target

Goal: $1M combined funding (grants, sponsorships, pilots)

Distribution strategy:
- 60% non-dilutive grants
- 20% corporate sponsorship
- 15% pilot revenue
- 5% public sponsorship

---

## Why Fund This?

- Small clinics are structurally underserved
- Vendor lock-in dominates healthcare tooling
- No open execution standard exists
- Interoperability gap remains unsolved

ClinicFlowAC aims to become the open operational backbone for small healthcare providers globally.
