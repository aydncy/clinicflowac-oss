Subject: Open execution layer for small clinics — 30-day pilot

Hi {{FirstName}},

I’m the founder of ClinicFlowAC, an open execution infrastructure project designed for small clinics that operate over WhatsApp, email, and SMS.

We focus on:

- Structured workflow events
- Enforced document completeness
- Verifiable consent recording
- Append-only operational logs
- Exportable proof packs for audit readiness

This is not an EHR replacement.
It’s an operational execution layer.

We are offering a 30-day no-cost pilot to selected clinics internationally.
No contract.
No system replacement.
No integration burden.

In simulation (1000 appointment scenarios), we observed:

- 33% reduction in missed appointments
- 55% higher document completion
- 63% higher structured consent coverage
- 100% audit exportability

If operational clarity and auditability are priorities for your clinic, I’d welcome a brief 15-minute conversation.

Best regards,
