## First Message After Connection

Hi {{FirstName}},

Thanks for connecting.

I’m working on ClinicFlowAC — an open execution layer that helps small clinics:

- Reduce missed appointments
- Enforce document completeness
- Record structured consent
- Export audit-ready proof packs

We recently ran a 1000-appointment simulation and observed measurable improvements in operational metrics.

We’re offering a 30-day structured workflow pilot (no cost, no contract).

If you're open to exploring workflow improvements, I’d be glad to share details.

Best,  
Aydın
