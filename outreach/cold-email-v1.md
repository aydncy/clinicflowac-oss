Subject: Quick question about your appointment workflow

Hi {{FirstName}},

I’m building an open execution infrastructure for small clinics that helps reduce missed appointments, enforce document completeness, and generate structured audit logs — without replacing your current systems.

We recently ran a simulation across 1000 appointment scenarios and observed:

- 33% reduction in missed appointments  
- 55% increase in document completion  
- 100% audit exportability  

We’re offering a 30-day structured workflow pilot (free, no contract).

If you're open to exploring operational improvements, I’d be happy to share details.

Best regards,
