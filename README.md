## Open Execution Infrastructure for Small-Clinic Healthcare

**From Messages → To Verified Execution**

WhatsApp / Email / SMS  
→ Structured Appointment  
→ Verified Documents  
→ Recorded Consent  
→ Immutable Audit Trail  

ClinicFlowAC is an open-source execution engine for modern clinic operations.

It transforms informal patient communication into structured, auditable, accountable healthcare workflows — without requiring a complex EHR migration.

This is not a chat tool.  
This is not another dashboard.  

This is execution infrastructure.

# The Structural Gap in Global Healthcare

Across the world, millions of small and mid-sized clinics operate critical workflows over:

- WhatsApp
- Email
- SMS
- Phone calls

What exists:  
Digital communication.

What does not exist:  
Structured execution.

The consequences:

- Missed or double-booked appointments  
- Incomplete documentation  
- Consent ambiguity  
- No operational ownership  
- No audit trail  
- No defensible proof  

Healthcare is digitized at the interface.  
It is fragmented at the execution layer.

ClinicFlowAC addresses the execution layer.

---

# What ClinicFlowAC Is

ClinicFlowAC is an open execution layer that:

1. Converts message intent into structured workflows  
2. Enforces document completeness before service delivery  
3. Records consent as a verifiable event  
4. Produces exportable, audit-ready proof artifacts  
5. Maintains immutable operational history  

Execution first.  
Compliance embedded.  
Proof generated by default.

---

# Core Capabilities

## 1. Intent → Workflow Engine
- Detects booking / reschedule / cancel intent
- Routes into structured state-driven flows
- Tracks lifecycle transitions with timestamps

## 2. Document Orchestration Layer
- Secure upload portals (outside chat threads)
- Appointment-type checklists
- Structured document verification

## 3. Consent & Event Integrity
- Structured consent capture
- Immutable event logging
- Exportable “proof pack”:
  - JSON (machine-readable)
  - Human-readable summary
  - PDF-ready output

## 4. Channel Abstraction Layer
Configurable failover routing:

WhatsApp → Email → SMS

Channel becomes transport.  
Workflow becomes source of truth.

---

# Architecture Philosophy

ClinicFlowAC is built around:

- Workflow-first design  
- Event-driven state management  
- Channel-agnostic communication abstraction  
- Exportable audit artifacts  
- Production-oriented modularity  
- Clear separation of operational and clinical systems  

It does not attempt to replace EHR systems.

It stabilizes operations before clinical integration.

---

# Public Deliverables (v0.1)

ClinicFlowAC already provides publicly inspectable foundational artifacts:

- Architecture overview (`docs/architecture.md`)
- Minimal data model (`docs/data-model.md`)
- Threat model (`docs/threat-model.md`)
- Proof pack sample format (`examples/proof-pack/sample.json`)

These artifacts establish the baseline for an open, interoperable execution infrastructure.

---

# Simulation Pilot (v0.1)

ClinicFlowAC includes a reproducible simulation model comparing
a baseline "message chaos" operational model with an event-based workflow model.

## Simulated Results (1000 appointments / 90 days)

- 33% relative reduction in missed appointments
- 55% relative increase in document completion
- 63% relative increase in structured consent coverage
- 38% faster workflow completion
- 100% audit exportability (proof pack availability)

See:
- `SIMULATION.md`
- `simulation/assumptions.md`
- `simulation/results.md`

These are simulation estimates.
Real-world pilot data will replace simulation values.

---

# Why This Matters

Most clinics do not fail due to lack of medical expertise.  
They fail due to operational entropy.

Operational entropy creates:

- Revenue leakage  
- Legal exposure  
- Staff burnout  
- Patient dissatisfaction  

ClinicFlowAC reduces entropy.

It provides:

- Clarity  
- Accountability  
- Proof  

---

# Strategic Positioning

ClinicFlowAC is positioned as:

- Open execution infrastructure for small-clinic healthcare
- A foundation layer for agentic healthcare workflows
- A workflow engine that can integrate with AI agents
- A compliance-ready operational backbone

This repository is the open-source core.

Future layers may include:
- Managed cloud services
- AI-assisted workflow routing
- Enterprise integrations
- Multi-clinic orchestration

# Quickstart

> ⚠️ This repository is a starter and reference architecture.  
> It is NOT a medical product.  
> Ships with demo data only.

## 🎬 Demo

WhatsApp simulation:
- **Book Appointment** → `appointmentCreated` event appended → visible in list
- **Cancel** → `appointmentCancelled` event
- **Reschedule** → `appointmentRescheduled` event

Event Sourcing model: every action is recorded and immutable.


## Requirements
- Flutter SDK (stable)
- Android emulator or device
- Git

## Run Demo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aydncy/clinicflowac-oss.git
cd clinicflowac-oss
flutter pub get
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
flutter run
```

# Demo Walkthrough

1. Create appointment  
2. Attach required document  
3. Record consent  
4. Export proof pack  

Observe:

- Structured state changes  
- Event history  
- Machine-readable audit artifact

# 90-Day Execution Roadmap

## Phase 1 — Operational Core (0–30 Days)
- Self-serve onboarding (<10 min clinic activation)
- Appointment workflow engine
- Reminder scheduler
- Minimal execution dashboard

## Phase 2 — Compliance Layer (31–60 Days)
- Document portal
- Appointment-based checklist logic
- Consent capture module
- Immutable event log
- Exportable audit reports

## Phase 3 — Channel Integrations (61–90 Days)
- WhatsApp Cloud API integration
- Microsoft Graph email integration
- SMS via CPaaS
- 5 pilot clinics
- First paid deployment

Measured output.  
Not feature accumulation.

# Funding & Acceleration

We are seeking non-dilutive funding and strategic sponsorship to accelerate a focused 90-day execution sprint.

Primary objectives:

- Production-grade MVP  
- Security hardening  
- Documentation  
- Pilot onboarding  
- Measurable operational improvements  

ClinicFlowAC aims to become the open operational backbone for small-clinic healthcare systems globally.

---
