# ClinicFlowAC — Impact Measurement Framework (v0)

ClinicFlowAC aims to reduce operational entropy in small clinics.

Impact must be measurable.

## Core Impact Metrics

### 1. Missed Appointment Reduction
Definition:
(Number of missed appointments / total scheduled appointments)

Target:
≥ 20% reduction within 90 days of pilot

---

### 2. Document Completion Rate
Definition:
(Complete document sets before appointment / total appointments)

Target:
≥ 30% improvement

---

### 3. Consent Recording Integrity
Definition:
(Appointments with structured consent record / total appointments)

Target:
≥ 95% coverage

---

### 4. Workflow Completion Time
Definition:
Average time from appointment creation → ready-for-service state

Target:
Reduction ≥ 25%

---

### 5. Audit Readiness Score
Definition:
Ability to export structured proof pack per appointment

Target:
100% exportability

---

## Pilot Plan

Initial validation:
- 3 small clinics
- 90-day measurement window
- Baseline metrics recorded before deployment
- Post-deployment comparison

---

## Reporting

Impact reports will include:
- Before/after comparison
- Quantitative metrics
- Qualitative staff feedback
- Operational cost implications

---

## Why This Matters

Most small clinics lack operational measurement tools.

ClinicFlowAC introduces measurable execution discipline.
